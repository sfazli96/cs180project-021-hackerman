### Description
This project is a data store that analyzes information about YouTube video data in different countries, and how each country's information compares with others (e.g. which videos are more popular between the United States and Germany). This project uses data from four countries: the United States (US), Germany (DE), Canda (CA), and the United Kingdom (UK).

### Setting Up the Server and Running It
To turn on the website, the user needs to do the following commands in the terminal:

`cd cs180project-021-hackerman/mysite`

`source venv/bin/activate`

If this is your first time downloading this, you need to install the following packages. Otherwise, you can skip this step:

`pip install python3`

`pip install Django`

`pip install googledrivedownloader`

`pip install plotly`

To run the server, run: `python3 manage.py runserver`

Once the command prompt has it up and running, go to the IP address link shown in the terminal.

### Turning Off the Server
To deactivate the website, you need to run `deactivate` in the terminal command line. Do this before exiting the terminal!
